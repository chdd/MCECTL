NAME
     afaexec - execute a machine on an input string

SYNOPSIS
     afaexec afa string

     afaexec string <afa

DESCRIPTION
     afaexec tests the word _s_t_r_i_n_g for membership in the language
     of  the machine _a_f_a.  If _s_t_r_i_n_g is accepted, afaexec returns
     1 and writes "input was accepted" on its standard error;  If
     all  the  symbols  of the _s_t_r_i_n_g are in the input symbol set
     and the _s_t_r_i_n_g is not in the language of the _a_f_a, it returns
     0 and writes "input was not accepted" on its standard error;
     Otherwise it writes "the input symbol is not legal"  on  its
     standard error.

     _a_f_a must conform to the Grail bit-wise format for  machines.
     _s_t_r_i_n_g should probably be protected from the shell by double
     quotes.

EXAMPLES
          % cat bitafa2
          symbols: [a,b,c]
          states:  3
          finals:  2
          head: 7 4
          6 2+7 1
          7 1
          0 1
          0 1
          6 2+7 1
          0 1
          0 1
          0 1
          7 3

          % afaexec bitafa2 "abc"
          input was accepted

          % afaexec bitafa2 "abbb"
          input was not accepted

          %afaexec "abc" < bitafa2
          input was accepted

          % afaexec bitafa2 "x"
          the input symbol is not legal

          %cat bitafa2 | afaexec "abc"
          input was accepted
