NAME
     afareverse - compute the reverse operation of a machine

SYNOPSIS
     afacomp afa

     afareverse <afa

DESCRIPTION
     afareverse computes the reverse of _a_f_a and writes the result
     on the standard output.

     _a_f_a must conform  to  the  Grail  bit-wise  _a_f_a  format  for
     machines.

     The reverse of a machine accepts any string whose reverse is
     accepted  by  the  original  machine.  reverse is defined in
     terms of the underlying alphabet of the machine.  afareverse
     computes  the  reverse only with respect to the symbols that
     appear in the original machine. The filter  first  check  to
     see  if the number of states of the afa exceeds 5 or not. If
     it does, the filter report the the user that the machine  is
     too big to do the operation, otherwise, the filter construct
     the reverse of the afa and write the result to the  standard
     output.
