NAME
     fmcomp - compute the completion of a machine

SYNOPSIS
     fmcomp fm

     fmcomp <fm

DESCRIPTION
     fmcomp computes the completion of _f_m and writes  the  result
     on the standard output.

     _f_m must conform to the Grail format for machines.

     A complete machine  is  one  in  which  every  state  has  a
     instruction  on  every  symbol in the alphabet.  fmcomp com-
     pletes its input by creating a new `sink' state that is used
     as  the  target  of  any  missing  instructions in the input
     machine.

     The alphabet used for completion is the set of symbols  that
     appear on instructions of the machine.
