NAME
     fmexec - execute a machine on an input string

SYNOPSIS
     fmexec [-d] fa string

     fmexec [-d] string <fm

DESCRIPTION
     fmexec tests the word _s_t_r_i_n_g for membership in the  language
     of  the machine _f_m.  If _s_t_r_i_n_g is accepted, fmexec returns 1
     and writes accepted on  its  standard  error;  otherwise  it
     returns  0  and  writes  not accepted on its standard error.
     fmexec can execute both deterministic  and  nondeterministic
     machines.

     The -d option causes fmexec to print each  instruction  that
     it  executes for each character of _s_t_r_i_n_g that is processed.
     In the case of nondeterministic machines, fmexec will  print
     the set of instructions that are executed for each character
     of _s_t_r_i_n_g.

     _f_m must conform to the Grail format  for  machines.   _s_t_r_i_n_g
     should  probably  be  protected  from  the  shell  by double
     quotes.
