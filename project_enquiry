Dear Professor ...

I'm a current 3rd-year undergraduate on the Maths & Computer Science course,
and I'm writing to enquire about the possibility of a 4th year project relating
to medical imaging, since it seems like the topic could be both interesting and
rewarding to work on.

Dear Professor Kreutzer,

I'm a 3rd-year Worcester undergraduate on the Maths & Computer Science course,
whom you may or may not remember from last year's tutorials on Logic and Proof
and on Object-Oriented Programming. I'm writing because I am interested in the
"Computing Tree-Decompositions of Graphs" project listed under your name on the
Comlab website [1].

While I don't currently have much experience of the graph-theoretical concepts
involved (or, indeed, of the details of modern SAT solvers), I am familiar with
C++ (and C and Java) and I would hope that my mathematical background would be
sufficient for me to pick up the relevant additional knowledge during the
course of the project.

Is this project still available? If so, is there any reason it would not be a
suitable topic for somebody with my background to attempt next year? Finally,
could you recommend some apposite reading material? Thank you very much.

Yours sincerely,
Dan Horgan
